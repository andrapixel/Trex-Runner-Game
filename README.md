# Trex-Runner-Game-Knock-off
The Desktop application version of the infamous Chrome T-rex Runner game that one can play when browsing offline. 

### Further developments I want to make
* store the game data in a relational database, so that some sort of evidence can be held + make a ranking board
* add a Night Mode feature, where the time of day changes after a certain amount of points is reached, thus adding to the endlessness feel of the game
* add sound effects for the actions of the T-rex (jumping, ducking), or dor when the game ends
* add other game themes (e.g. Equestrian mode, Gymnastics mode - those would entail using different images for the trex and the background objects, but also modifying the range of motion of the T-rex accordingly)
